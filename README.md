# My own dotfiles

Dotfiles are awesome! They give that extra bit of personality to mundane stuffs on a computer.

The dotfiles that I use are uploaded into this project and updated regularly to reflect the ones I have on my system. The dotfiles I mostly customise and use are:

- .zshrc
- .eslintrc

It's not much, but you gotta start somewhere right? Right?!

I included some very handy dandy install scripts inside the different folders to get you up and running with my setup!

Oh yeah, before I forget. The themes I use for literally everything is called *Nord*. I think it's pretty neat!

Here's a screenshot of my terminal with my config and the Nord theme enabled:

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
